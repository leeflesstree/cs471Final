# Facial Emotion Recognition Using Facial Landmarks and Machine Learning

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members
-   Alexander Nicholas
-   Kieran Hawkins
-   Michael Duggan

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning system that recognizes **facial emotions** using only **facial landmark-based features**â€”no deep CNNs or raw image classification. We use a mix of **interpretable models** and one **neural network** for comparison.

The primary goal is to assess whether lightweight models can classify emotions effectively using geometric patterns in facial expressions.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
Each team member was responsible for one model:
- **Logistic Regression** () â€“ baseline linear model for interpretability.
- **Decision Tree** () â€“ visual and rule-based approach for capturing nonlinear relations.
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** () â€“ simple neural network for benchmarking performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [FER-2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- 35,000+ 48x48 grayscale facial images labeled with 7 emotion categories:
  - Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Face Detection** â€“ Detect faces using `face_recognition`.
2. **Landmark Extraction** â€“ 68 facial landmarks per image.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Distances, angles, ratios between key points.
4. **Standardization** â€“ Normalize features across dataset.

## ðŸ§ª Experiments
We evaluated each model using:
- Train/Test split (80/20)
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
